Story time! The Edinburgh Genome Foundry, where I worked a few years, is a platform that sells custom synthetic DNA. Customers email long sequences (ATGCTAC..., typically 10,000 nucleotides or longer) which are then synthesized on the robotic setup below, by progressively assembling smaller DNA fragments into bigger ones.</description></item></channel></rss>
