or only to come up with it If you want to stitch more than 2 bits of DNA together, the most popular method these days is probably Golden Gate Assembly. In a nutshell, you mix DNA fragments in a tube where enzymes will cut their flanks to create overhangs (also called sticky ends), then fuse the overhangs together to form the desired DNA construct:</description></item></channel></rss>
