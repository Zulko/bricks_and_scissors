# The shortest path to DNA construction

```
def
graph = nx.DiGraph(
    optimal_cost_for_sequence(sequence[i:j])
    for i in in
nx.shortest_path(graph[]
```

This is one of the optimization tricks I am the most proud of, but as far as I can tell I might not have been the first to use it. The DNA manufacturer Twist Bioscience has been posting [job adverts](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/TwistBioscience/84826182-python-software-engineer-algorithm)
) "Software engineers with graph theory skills" for years and my guess is that this is the kind of things they do. In the past years, I have also seen Doulix (one of the European DNA foundries that invested the most on software) and more recently from this project from the University of Washington, which promises to  
What is really interesting is that there is many things you can do with the graphs to speed up the computation or reflect the limitations of the assembly methods.

but the function you are
