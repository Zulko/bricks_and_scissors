Few movies have inspired bioengineers the way Jurassic Park did. [Where I work](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/) people wear T-shirts with the park's logo, there's a 3-meter plastic T-Rex skeleton in a corridor, and a full-sized Jeff Goldblum cardboard cutout wearing a Jeff Goldblum sweater.

While the Steven Spielberg adaptation is world-famous, the original 1990 novel by Michael Crichton deserves a larger audience. It is a bit longer and darker than the movie (you get to see a flying dino attack, a stealth infiltration of a raptor nest, and procompsognathids invading Costa Rica). But it really shines for its bioengineering discussions that not only perfectly capture the field and its promises as they were 30 years ago, but also asks questions of incredible relevance today.

These reading notes are organized by theme, more or less in the order they appear in the book, from corporate matters to technical and ethical challenges. Some pages of the novel are so well written that it is tempting to quote them entirely, but I cut there and there for fluidity (and to avoid a copyright strike). I added comments and context at the end of each section, but this is such a large field that these are necessary partial and subjective. If I missed anything or said something stupid, [hit me](mailto:valentin.zulkower@gmail.com) and I'll fix it.

### Bio-business: _“a scientific gold rush"_



The book's opening sentences clearly set the tone:

> _The late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing proportions: the headlong and furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering. This enterprise has proceeded so rapidly-with so little outside commentary-that its dimensions and implications are hardly understood at all._

Biotechnology, the author argues, will be *"the greatest revolution in human history"* and will *"outdistance atomic power and computers in its effect on our everyday lives"*. But unlike  state-led nuclear research, bioengineering is decentralized, taking place in *"more than two thousand laboratories in America"*, with *"500 corporations spending five billion dollars a year"*, outside any regulation:

> _No federal laws regulate it. There is no coherent government policy, in America or anywhere else in the world. And because the products of biotechnology range from drugs to farm crops to artificial snow, an intelligent policy is difficult._

This, the author continues, was made worse when cash-loaded private companies started making academia irrelevant, starting with the 1976 founding of Genentech (a [real company](https://www.gene.com/) and GMO pioneer, now a subsidiary of Roche). As one character later puts it, _"life is too short, and DNA too long. If you want to get something done, stay out of universities"._ This resulted in only _"very few molecular biologists without commercial affiliations."_, with research _"done in secret, and in haste, and for profit"_.



### Comments

- Here and throughout the book, you can feel the influence of DNA pioneer [Erwin Chargaff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Chargaff) (1905-2002), who became a stark critic of bioengineering in the 1950s throughout the 2000s, and in particular [this 1970 letter](https://sniadecki.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/chargaff-meddling/), which still resonates in so many ways that I'll probably write a post about it later. The letter ends with *"You cannot recall a new life form"*, which is Jurassic Park's opening quote, and probably the inspiration for the the famous "life finds a way".

- One common argument in Chargaff's letter and this section is the lack of policies. This is not my area of expertise, but thirty years later, despite some progress (policies around stem cells, gain-of-function research, etc.), regulating bioengineering is still an ethical and economic minefield for the US, China, the European Union, and others. Nobody wants to be the first to cross the line on designer babies, artificial wombs, and bio-weaponry. But no one wants to be last, either.

- Academic biotech still doesn't enjoy the billions of dollars biotech companies can secure. However universities have not been made irrelevant yet, with a number of academic labs and consortias attacking ambitious, miillion-dollar projects (like [fully synthetic chromosomes](https://engineeringbiologycenter.org/)), and producing breakthroughs like CRISPR. And while biotech remains a rich-lab's game, DNA sequencing and gene synthesis have become so inexpensive since the 1990s that many biology research projects are now within reach of the more modest academic budgets. DNA may not be "too long" for academic life after all.

 ### Bio-marketing: _"What is the biological equivalent of a Sony Walkman?”_

If Michael Crichton resents for-profit biotech, it is because it focuses not on important, life-saving research, but on futile commercial products. In particular what the he calls _"consumer biologicals"_, bio-products that could make it into everyone's hands - as an executive asks in the novel, _“what is the biological equivalent of a Sony Walkman?”_.

You can sense the author's skepticism in the examples of bioproducts he describes: _"a paler trout for better visibility in the stream"_ which is also tasteless, soggy and sunburned. _"Square trees for easier lumbering"_. _"Injectable scent cells so you'll always smell of your favorite perfume"_. An engineered mini-elephant pet that acts _"like a vicious rodent"_. And the author to comment:

> _The fact that biotechnology can be applied to the industries traditionally subject to the vagaries of fashion, such as cosmetics and leisure activities, heightens concern about the whimsical use of this powerful new technology._

In the book, the project of a dinosaur park itself comes from a cynical approach to consumer economics. _"Fight illness and disease?"_ asks John Hammond, the park's founder,  _"Dear me, no. That’s a terrible idea. Sick people aren’t going to pay a thousand dollars a dose for needed medication, they’ll be outraged. Your patent applications will be denied. Your permits will be delayed. Now if I charge $5000 a day for my park, who is going to stop me?"_. 

Business-first principles don't just impact the line of products, they also control the bioengineering of Jurassic Park, where dinos have extra genes to make them grow faster (_"We didn’t want to wait. We have investors to consider."_). Other genes are added for the sole purpose of making the dinos patentable. And it is suggested the company could engineer "pygmy" dinosaurs to be sold as pets, which would only eat food that the company produces - a textbook [razor-and-blades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_and_blades_model) business model.


**Comments:**

- Michael Crichton has a talent for mixing real technology and science-fiction. The GMO fish industry was [already a thing in the 1980s](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0387-257) but I couldn't find any real-life projects of paler trouts. Similarly, I found no mention of square-shaped trees, although [house-shaped trees](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johncumbers/2019/09/26/can-we-redesign-the-modern-city-with-synthetic-biology-could-we-grow-our-houses-instead-of-building-them/?sh=6ec09df8299b) are often promised. Finally, scent cells are a thing, and they had their [interesting moments](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/24/sweet-peach-vagina-smell-like-fruit-taste-diet-coke-probiotic) (don't miss the mention of banana-smelling dog poo!)
- Even though Crichton's examples may be made-up, his comment on *"the industries traditionally subject to the vagaries of fashion"* is still spot on today: the same biotechnology that produces new therapies can also lead to new food and chemicals. Strain from companies like Amyris or Ginkgo Bioworks produce molecules and proteins used in medicines, cloths, cell-phones, recreational cannabis, food colorants, alternative meat, pet food, car tires, cosmetics, paint, and many more products. However, in these examples the final product is entirely "grown", but rather a mix of bioengineering and natural or chemical products. The industry has yet to come up with a true "biological walkman". A class of true *"consumer biologicals"* coming to market are genetically modified pets, which became a thing with [glowing fishes](https://www.glofish.com/), and may soon be joined by [CRISPRed hypo-alergenic cats](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02779-3). 
- John Hammond's remarks on public outrage and government intervention in medication prices has had recent echoes, with [California moving to produce its own insulin](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/California-manufacture-insulin/626916/#:~:text=California%20is%20preparing%20to%20produce,biosimilar%20insulin%20products%20for%20Californians.) to slash costs, and with the [2015 Daraprim price hike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli#Turing_Pharmaceuticals) from \$13 to \$750 a pill, rasing questions from US Senators, and a FBI probe into the CEO's finances.

### Biotech companies: _"as reckless as ever"_

Michael Crichton is not only displeased with the biotech industry's offerings, he also doesn't think much of its leaders. The parks' creator, John Hammond, is described as a _"flamboyant, born showman"_ whose first venture was a pigmy pet elephant, and a bit of a scam - his prototype "mini-elephant" hadn't really been genetically modified as Hammond claimed to investors, but altered via a hormonal treatment.

Hammond's main competitor, the company BioSyn, has done much worse: they vaccinated Chilean farmers with an untested rabbies virus that had been genetically modified to be airborne, and that they had transported in a carry-on bad in a commercial flight. And they got away with it:

> _It was outrageous. It was irresponsible. It was criminally negligent. But no action was taken against Biosyn. The Chilean farmers who unwittingly risked their lives were ignorant peasants; the government of Chile had an economic crisis to worry about; and the American authorities had no jurisdiction. Biosyn was still as reckless as ever. And other American companies were hurrying to set up facilities in foreign countries that lacked sophistication about genetic research. Countries that perceived genetic engineering to be like any other high-tech development, and thus welcomed it to their lands, unaware of the dangers posed._

**Comments**

- The fake-it-until-you-make-it attitude of John Hammond and his pigmy elephant is still common today, the most famous recent example being been Theranos and their not-really-working blood testing kit.
- InGen and BioSyn are great biotech company names. BioSyn is likely a pun on "bio sin", but surprisingly (and possibly not on purpose) also the name of a [real-life Californian vaccine products company](https://biosyncorp.com/biosyn-corp-news/about-us/production-history/) which started in the 1970s and also sought commercialization authorizations in South America in the 2000s, what where the odds! And a whole bioengineering subfield called "synbio" (for Synthetic Biology) emerged in the 2000s.
InGen still doesn't share a name with a real-life company, although Scotland-based synbio company [Ingenza](https://www.ingenza.com/) (founded in 2002) comes close.
- The fictional vaccinal experimentations of Biosyn sound unfortunately credible. [Here is the wikipedia page of human experimentation for the US alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States), in case you wanted a bad day. Note that only a very small fraction of scandals relates to vaccines, and the vast majority of misconducts were carried out on US territory and by state organisms, not companies. The [Guatemala syphilis experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala_syphilis_experiments) (read the study detail section!) in particular involved the US government and *possibly* one US company (there's a trial in progress and I'd rather not get sued).
The list of experimentations on US territory stops abruptly after the 60s, possibly because of the success of new regulation measures, but then a few scandals involving US pharma companies [start emerging in Africa in the 90s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_experimentation_in_Africa).
- Another ethical issue raised by Biosyn's engineered rabbies virus is that of gain-of-function research, whereby scientists add a new capability to a virus for research or therapeutic purposes. This is still a hot topic today (especially with questions around whether COVID was a consequence of gain-of-function research) and regulations get re-evaluated all the time. The US notably decreed a [pause in experimentations](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/gain-function-research-involving-potential-pandemic-pathogens) between 2014 and 2017.



### Bio-espionage: _"A bacterium worth five billion dollars"_

Industrial espionage is at the heart of the Jurassic Park story, where Biosyn attempts to steal their competitor's dinosaur embryos, with catastrophic consequences. As the author explains, _"a single microscopic bacterium, too small to see with the naked eye, but containing the genes for a heart-attack enzyme, streptokinase, or for “ice-minus,” which prevented frost damage to crops, might be worth five billion dollars to the right buyer. And that fact of life had created a bizarre new world of industrial espionage."_


In the book, we learn that this is not Biosyn's first rodeo: a few years before, they were stealing strains from Cetus (a [real pharma company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus_Corporation), now part of Novartis, where PCR was invented in 1983!). They convinced a disgruntled employee  to _"quit Cetus for Biosyn, and take five strains of engineered bacteria with her. The geneticist simply put a drop of each on the fingernails of one hand, and walked out the door._

**Comments:**

I couldn't find any real-world trace of that fingernail bio-theft stunt, but it is definitely credible. Some microbes can survive on a piece of paper, and custom officers will have a hard time detecting that the hand-drawn circle on the back of a research article actually mark the spot for genetically modified spores.

### Paleobiology: *"no dinosaur DNA was known to exist anywhere in the world"*

For the story to work, it must convince us of one thing: that it is possible to clone dinosaurs back to life. And the first step is finding enough DNA to reconstitute a whole dino genome.

Here's how the book presents the state of the art on dino cloning:

> _There had been discussion of cloning dinosaurs in the technical literature as far back as 1982. With each passing year, the manipulation of DNA had grown easier. Genetic material had already been extracted from Egyptian mummies, and from the hide of a quagga, a zebra-like African animal that had become extinct in the 1880s. By 1985, it seemed possible that quagga DNA might be reconstituted, and a new animal grown. If so, it would be the first creature brought back from extinction solely by reconstruction of its DNA. If that was possible, what else was also possible? The mastodon? The saber-toothed tiger? The dodo? Or even a dinosaur?_

> _No dinosaur DNA was known to exist anywhere in the world. But by grinding up large quantities of dinosaur bones it might be possible to extract fragments of DNA. Formerly it was thought that fossilization eliminated all DNA. Now that was recognized as untrue._

**Comments:**

As always, the author mixes fascinating science with just enough lies to suspend disbelief. The one big lie here is the last sentence. Fossilization does eliminate DNA: which [doesn't survive more than 5 million years](https://www.livescience.com/54574-can-we-clone-dinosaurs.html) according to the current consensus. So while the saber-toothed tiger, mastodon and quagga could be cloned one day, 65-million-year old dinos are out of the picture. We're getting better at [identifying older DNA remnants](https://www.livescience.com/dinosaur-dna-fossils.html) though, which keeps hopes alive to one day decipher at least some snippets.

The rest of the discussion is more rooted in facts: de-extinction of lost species from recovered DNA is theoretically possible (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-extinction)), and while de-extinction initiatives have been multiplied in recent years (from the passenger pigeon to the dodo, from the cave lion to the Xerces butterfly), we still haven't had much success.

Although I couldn't identify what the _"1982 discussion on cloning dinosaurs"_ refers to, this passage seems to have been largely written from [_To Clone a Dinosaur_ (New Scientist 1985)](https://cpb-eu-w2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.bristol.ac.uk/dist/5/537/files/2019/07/1985clone.pdf), which discusses bringing back the quagga. However, there has never been a real project to revive Quaggas from reconstituted DNA that I could find. The current Quagga Project aims, instead, at selectively breeding zebras (which are the same species) until the offspring loses some of their stripes and start looking like quaggas.

To this day, only one extinct animal has been successfully brought back to life from DNA. The last Pyrenean ibex (a species of wild goat) died in 2000, but in 2003 scientist transferred DNA from its ear into a goat egg cell and impregnating a female goat. The resulting baby ibex lived only 7 minutes, however, because of a lung defect - and even if she had lived, she would have had no males to reproduce with, which doesn't constitute a sustainable de-extinction.   

One piece of biology missing is how dinosaurs would adapt to our 65-million-year-younger ecosystem, full of animals, parasites and pathogens that they haven't evolved with. Another common argument is that dinosaurs evolved in an atmosphere with much more oxygen (which is why some could afford to be so big). However, species have been seen to adapt to lower oxygen levels - the people of the Lima plateau live half less oxygen than the people on  

### Bioinformatics: “What kind of a database has three billion records ?”

Before the dinosaurs are flesh and blood in the park, they are DNA sequences in a computer.

**Comments:**

We'll see that while the science in jurassic park is still futuristic today, the informatics that were cutting edge for the 1990s have grown old.
Jurassic Park also talks a lot about actual software. Their hardware has grown old.

Which, to stay in the software metaphore, is a bit like copying over code you don't understand from Stackoverflow.

Benchling comparison

### Biofoundries: "You are standing in the middle of an incredibly powerful genetics factory."

Three yet-unfulfilled premises keep dino-making from being a real job today:
TODO - complete
[NOTE] they never talk about how the DNA is actually assembled.

First, we'd need to find near-intact genome sequences of several dinosaur species. In Jurassic Park, this DNA comes from 60-million-year-old mosquitoes trapped in amber, which is a very cool idea. In the real world, Dino DNA traces may have been found on some bones, but [this article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/possible-dinosaur-dna-has-been-found/) says that DNA will mostly degrade in 7 million years. So mammoth and XXX are still in range, but intact dino DNA would be a huge surprise.

Loy

Crichton knew his biology (he had an MD) and he wants us to know it:

> _Actually, dinosaur DNA is somewhat easier to extract by this process than mammalian DNA. The reason is that mammalian red cells have no nuclei, and thus no DNA in their red cells. To clone a mammal, you must find a white cell, which is much rarer than red cells. But dinosaurs had nucleated red cells, as do modern birds. It is one of the many indications we have that dinosaurs aren't really reptiles at all. They are big leathery birds._

Second, repairing a 3-billion-basepair chromosome with possibly thousands of missing fragments is near impossible. In the book, this is done via restriction-ligation techniques, and that's a pretty generous assessment of the technique. Gene editing techniques like CRISPR are getting us there, but are not yet at that level. Another possibility would be to redesign and synthesize the genome from scratch. This could be possible in the next 10 years, after all a plan to do so with a 1-billion-basepairs human chromosome is already in the works.

Last but not least, we still don't have the biological understanding to determine what extra genes to add to a dinosaur to replace missing genes and ensure they'd survive in today's atmosphere and ecosystem.

The author goes around all of that by making Jurassic Park multi-billion dollars project with an aggressive, spare-no-expense research policy. Their machines are the best money can buy. They'll acquire whatever they need, even it's an amber mining company. And above all, they nailed their Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle: 

> Sometimes we think we have an animal correctly made-from the standpoint of the DNA, which is our basic work-and the animal grows for six months and then something untoward happens. And we realize there is some error. A releaser gene isn’t operating. A hormone not being released. Or some other problem in the developmental sequence. So we have to go back to the drawing board with that animal, so to speak.”

As an additional trivia, one of the challenges with biofoundries is being able to identify what organisms are engineered and which are not. This is still a subject of research today (see for instance the [IARPA FELIX program](https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/felix))
TODO - complete

### Biodesign: "He had created freely"

If there is one person living the dream in this story, it is Jurassic Park's chief scientist, Frank Wu:

> _When you compared the DNA of man and the DNA of a lowly bacterium, you found that only about 10 percent of the strands were different. This innate conservatism of DNA emboldened Wu to use whatever DNA he wished. In making his dinosaurs, Wu had manipulated the DNA as a sculptor might clay or marble. He had created freely._

Goosebumps! Wu is so confident in his skills that he starts preferring artistic license over scientific reality:

> _“Right now, as we stand here, almost no one in the world has ever seen an actual dinosaur. Nobody knows what they're really like. People aren't accustomed to seeing large animals that are so quick. They want to see their expectation, which is quite different. This park is entertainment. And entertainment has nothing to do with reality. After all, these animals are already modified. Why not push ahead to make exactly the kind of dinosaur that we'd like to see? One that is more acceptable to visitors, and one that is easier for us to handle? A slower, more docile version for our park?”_

**Comments**

- Let's tackle an unimportant inexactitude first: there is way more than 10% difference between the genome of a bacteria and human genomes (which are about a thousand times larger and have about 10 times more genes). This sentence may be possibly a paraphrase of genetician Jacques Monod's 1972 hyperbole _"all that is true for E coli, is true for the elephant"_, and accentuate the universality of the genetic code that opens so many doors to genetic engineer: a human protein like insulin can be expressed in bacteria, and vice-versa.
- You have to admire Crichton's style in the "clay or marble" metaphor -  bioengineers see themselves as a modern Michelangelos, while the whole book is painting them genetic Frankensteins.
- _"Creating freely"_ with genomes is still bioscience-fiction today. Despite the emergence of the term "biodesigner" in recent years, our understanding of biology is still not advanced enough to reliably predict the results of genetic modifications, on bacteria, let alone more complex organisms.
- But by placing the story in a technological context where science is advanced enough to offer artistic freedom, the author can touch on a very important topic: the weight of fictional and commercial influences on the work of the biodesigner. For dinosaurs, these influences look like this:

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKaCergUUAABRv2?format=jpg&name=small)

<!-- https://twitter.com/tinysnekcomics/status/1199789820899291136 -->

Humans have modified nature and bred new organisms for thousands of years via domestication and crossing, but never before did they have the tools to do it so rapidly, and with such a power concentration in the hand of so few people. This increases the risk for cultural bias in the way this generation of bioengineers will change nature, an idea beautifully developed in Yuval Noah Hariri's *Homo Deus*:

> During the twenty-first century the border between history and biology is likely to blur (...). As human fictions are translated into genetic and electronic codes, the intersubjective reality [religions, values, and other cultural elements] will swallow up the objective reality (...). Fiction might thereby become the most potent force on earth, surpassing even wayward asteroids and natural selection. Hence if we want to understand our future, cracking genomes and crunching numbers is hardly enough. We must also decipher the fictions that give meaning to the world.

And in *Sapiens*, the same author focuses on the remodeling of humans in particular:

> Today, the 4-billion-year-old regime of natural selection is facing a completely different challenge. In laboratories throughout the world, scientists are engineering living beings. (...) The pace of technological development will soon lead to the replacement of Homo sapiens by completely different beings who possess not only different physiques, but also very different cognitive and emotional worlds. (...) The first generation of these gods would be shaped by the cultural ideas of their human designers. Would they be created in the image of capitalism, of Islam, or of feminism? The answer to this question might send them careening in entirely different directions. (...) The only thing we can try to do is to influence the direction scientists are taking. Since we might soon be able to engineer our desires too, perhaps the real question facing us is not ‘What do we want to become?’, but ‘What do we want to want?’ Those who are not spooked by this question probably haven’t given it enough thought.

### Bioversioning: _"You mean like software? New releases?”_

> _"The most recent [releases of the animals] are version 4.1 or 4.3. We’re considering going to version 4.4. It is like software, in a way (...) Sometimes there are bugs and Dr. Wu's labs have to make a new version. And we need to keep track of what version we have out there.”_

> _“It was Wu's deepest perception that the park was fundamentally sound. Whatever problems might arise in the DNA were essentially point-problems in the code, causing a specific problem in the phenotype: an enzyme that didn’t switch on, or a protein that didn’t fold. Whatever the difficulty, it was always solved with a relatively minor adjustment in the next version._

> The idea of living creatures being numbered like software, being subject to updates and revisions, troubled Grant.

### Comments

It's interesting that software metaphors for bioengineering were already everywhere in 1990 Jurassic Park, long before Synthetic Biology's "coding with DNA" ambitions in 2000s. The first quote, for instance, could be straight out of a company's firmware department, but they're talking about dinosaurs:

Jurassic Park is a cautionary tale about trying to achieve bio-safety through engineering. A central (and slightly out-of-place) character is a chaos-theory professor, whose main contribution is to explain how life is a complex system, and complex systems tend to have chaotic behaviors: small perturbations can have large consequences that equations or even a super-computer couldn't predict.

![](https://y.yarn.co/4b6a8884-bcf6-435f-9081-bb28c34bd3c3_text.gif)

This unpredicability would make total biosafety unattainable, yet versioning and continuous improvement could give us a false impression that we are on top of things. You can keep a CHANGELOG of your project and think that it describes every new feature and bug patch. But new features may also lead to unexpected emergent behaviors, such as your project multiplying, spreading and eating people.


### Biocontainment: _"We engineered the resort and engineered the animals."_

The book reveals from the prologue that dinosaurs escaped the park and are living their best life eating small children off the Costa-Rican coast. This gives a much more pathetic vibe to the company scientists boasting how they _"engineered the resort and engineered the animals"_ to contain the dinos.

A first biocontainment was to make all dinosaurs female, to prevent reproduction. But, in a plot twist as cool as scientifically improbable, the dinosaurs start spontaneously changing sex under the influence of frog genes that the park's engineers used to complete their genomes.

As a second contingency, the dinos also lack a lysine-producing gene, so that they couldn't survive on their own without receiving lysine tablets every 12 hours. But this also fails to keep them in the park: they compensate by eating chicken, soy, agamama beans and other lysine-rich food in their environment.

### Comments

- A project like jurassic park probably had the means and incentives to make the dinosaurs fully sterile by ways of genetics, pills or surgery. But judging by his other books, Crichton wanted the key twist to rely on the core subject of the story. Sex changing frogs are a nice reminder that nature is weird and researchers have blind spots.
- Disappointingly, the Jurassic Park movie reworked the "lysine contingency" idea, presenting it as a kill-switch to be used to neutralize dinosaurs in case of emergencies. This makes for higher-intensity drama though, with Hammond taking the executive decision not to activate the contingency, prioritizing the dinos over his grandchildren's safety.
- The [Jurassic Park fandom wiki](https://jurassicpark.fandom.com/wiki/Lysine_contingency) tells us that, in the more recent video game _Jurassic Park: Operation genesis_, the strategy is replaced by a so-called _"lethal gene"_ that can kill escaped dinosaurs. This is a more credible mechanism - many natural organisms have such "suicide genes". For instance bacterium E. coli will kill itself with gene *ccdB* if it detects an anomaly (an absence of plasmid). And this gene has been repurposed by bioengineers to select bacteria with a desired gene or behavior. 

When you look at what scientists have used for bioI'm not a big specialist of biocontainment, however, you find none of the above. I am not a big specialist but [this paper](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/119226/Collins-Main%20text.docx?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) gives a nice perspective on what has been tried so far, and what's coming. In a nutshell:

- Species designed or optimized for human-specific needs (like big tomatoes, colorful potatoes, etc.) have a disadvantage against wild species, and are less likely to become invasive. Species engineered for a fitness advantage (cold resistance or resistance to a  parasite) are more likely to become a problem.
- Possibly linked to the previous point, there have been no reports of damage caused by GMOs escaping and colonizing the world so far (yay!). However there even when a species doesn't escape, some genes in it (like a freeze- or antobiotic-resistance gene) could be stolen by e.g. microbes for their own profit.

- GURT: not really a great idea of progress.

- Another method, not yet used beyond some proofs of concepts, relies on xenobiology, where the organism is heavily modified so that it relies on unnatural biology, either using non-natural DNA bases (i.e. not A,T,G, or C) or using amino-acids different from the 20 usual types.

### Bioludditism: _"Scientists have an elaborate line of bullshit..."_

Say it, Dr. Malcolm!

This famous quote from the movie's lunchtime monologue appears actually quite later in the book, when the same character, injured and under morphine, goes on to attack the whole idea of scientific progress:

> _"Scientists have an elaborate line of bullshit about how they are seeking to know the truth about nature. Nobody is driven by abstractions like 'seeking truth.' Scientists are actually preoccupied with accomplishment. So they are focused on whether they can do something. They never stop to ask if they should do something. Discovery, they believe, is inevitable. If they don't do it, someone else will. That's the game in science. Even pure scientific discovery is an aggressive, penetrative act. Astronauts leave trash on the moon. They have to leave their mark. They can't just watch. They can't just appreciate. They can't just fit into the natural order. They have to make something unnatural happen. That is the scientist's job, and now we have whole societies that try to be scientific."_

Ok, but doesn't this lead to great scientific advances?

> _"What advances? The number of hours women devote to housework has not changed since 1930. Thirty thousand years ago, when men were doing cave paintings at Lascaux, they worked twenty hours a week to provide themselves with food and shelter and clothing. The rest of the time, they could play, or sleep, or do whatever they wanted. And they lived in a natural world, with clean air, clean water, beautiful trees and sunsets. I want people to wake up. We've had four hundred years of modern science, and we ought to know by now what it's good for, and what it's not good for.”_

And to conclude the rant: we just don't deserve scientific power.

> _"Most kinds of power require a substantial sacrifice by whoever wants the power. There is an apprenticeship, a discipline lasting many years. But scientific power is like inherited wealth: attained without discipline. You read what others have done, and you take the next step. You can do it very young. You can make progress very fast. There is no mastery: old scientists are ignored. There is no humility before nature. There is only a get-rich-quick, make-a-name-for-yourself-fast philosophy. You don't even know exactly what you have done, but already you have reported it, patented it, and sold it. And the buyer will have even less discipline than you. The buyer simply purchases the power, like any commodity. The buyer doesn't even conceive that any discipline might be necessary.”_

**Notes**

We get it, Dr. Malcolm doesn't trust scientific progress. In the film, the park's boss calls him a [luddite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite).

The idea that pre-agricultural humans had pretty great lives is widespread, you also find it in Hariri's _Sapiens_:

> _[We] had been living a fairly comfortable life hunting and gathering until about 10,000 years ago, but then began to invest more and more effort in cultivating wheat. Within a couple of millennia, humans in many parts of the world were doing little from dawn to dusk other than taking care of wheat plants."_.

Woof. Time to forget about all that, and get back to the lab.

## TLDR; 

Let's summarize! Jurassic park is a cautionary tale with many warnings:
- The industry will betray the promises of bioengineering to produce futile, commercial products.
- Biotech companies are reckless with one another and with the populations they put at risk. The examples of industrial espionage and human experimentation given in the book are a bit extreme (I couldn't find close real-life examples) but credible.
- Living organisms are complex systems prone to unexpected behavior, scientists have blind spots, and engineering concepts such as continuous improvement and versioning shouldn't give us a sense that things are under control.
- Under the cover of "doing science", we'll want to remodel nature to fit our cultural and fictional obsessions.
- The more advanced (and the more accessible) the technology will be, the more it will be used by and for people who lack any ethical discipline. Progress can and should be questioned.

From a technological point of view:
- The Large computerized and automated biolabs described in Jurassic Park are now a reality.
- We'll probably never get viable dino DNA (it's too old!) and even if we did, we wouldn't be able to understand and engineer such long and damaged/incomplete genomes - come back in a few more years.
- While Jurassic Park's bioengineering is still science fiction, we have way better computers (and better-looking biology software) today than the ones described in the book.
- The biocontainment measures used by the park are a bit naive, although it is the point - many safety measures will look naive in retrospective) Some biocontainment techniques like GURT (where only plants grown at a certain temperature can have offspring) have been successfully used, but full-proof biocontainment techniques (like xenobiology) are still in the works.
