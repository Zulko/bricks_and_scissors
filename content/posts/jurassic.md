One thing Jurassic Park managed very well is to capture the imagination of a generation of bioengineers. People at [Ginkgo](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/) wear T-shirts with the famous logo. There's a 3-meter plastic T-Rex skeleton in a corridor. There's a real-size Jeff Goldblum cardboard cutout by my desk, and it's wearing a Jeff Goldblum-patterned shirt.

While many have seen the movie, few have read the original novel by Michael Crichton. Like the movie, it has a nerdy first half, and action-packed finale. The story is a bit longer (you get to see more of Costa Rica, flying dinos, and even a raptor nest), but it is particularly interesting for its richer (and incredibly well written) scientific discussions. Here are some spoilers!

# Biology as a business

Since the 1976 Genentech venture

> whenever debate arose about technological matters, disinterested scientists were available to discuss the issues at the highest
> levels. But that is no longer true. There are very few molecular biologists and very few research institutions without commercial affiliations. The old days are gone. Genetic research continues, at a more furious pace than ever. But it is done in secret, and in haste, and for profit.

But what the author really fears is that companies will take biotech away from life-saving therapeutics, and more towards _consumer biology_ that will put (mostly superflous) biological products into everyone's hands, for instance a pet dwarf elephant. _“What is the biological equivalent of a Sony Walkman?”_, a company asks, before coming up with a new species of trout that's paler and therefore easier to fish, but also soggy and tasteless.

The Park itself is born from this reasoning: _Fight illness and disease? Dear me, no. That’s a terrible idea (...) Sick people aren’t going to pay a thousand dollars a dose for needed medication (...) they’ll be outraged. (...) Now if I charge $5000 a day for my park, who is going to stop me?"_.

# Biosecurity

Spoiler alert: that doesn't work, and Dinos migrate towards new territories where they eat lysine-rich foods like soy and chicken (not sure how they figured that one out in a single generation).

> Universities are no longer the intellectual centers of the country (...). Since World War II, all the really important discoveries have come out of private laboratories. The laser, the transistor the polio vaccine, the microchip, the hologram,
> the personal computer, magnetic resonance imaging, CAT scans-the list goes on and
> on. (...) If you want to do something important in computers or genetics, you don’t go to a university.

> If you were going to start a bioengineering company, Henry, what would you do? Would you make products to help mankind, to fight illness and disease? Dear me, no. That’s a terrible idea. A very poor use of new technology.

> Sick people aren’t going to pay a thousand dollars a dose for needed medication-they won’t be grateful, they’ll be outraged (...) Your patent application will be denied. Your permits will be delayed. Something will force you to see reason-and to sell your drug at a lower cost.

> If I charge five thousand dollars a day for my park, who is going to stop
> me? After all, nobody needs to come here.

rich lab's game.

# Consumer biologicals

Instead "what is the sony walkman of the ".

I don't think synbio succeeded here. It will bring biology-made products in the house (food, cloth, materials) live synthetic organisms generally stay outside of your home. Hypoallergenic cat.
