One thing Jurassic Park managed very well is to capture the imagination of a generation of bioengineers. People at [Ginkgo](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/) wear T-shirts with the famous logo. There's a 3-meter plastic T-Rex skeleton in a corridor. There's a real-size Jeff Goldblum cardboard cutout by my desk, and it's wearing a Jeff Goldblum sweater.

While many have seen the movie, few read the 1990 original novel by Michael Crichton. Like the movie, it has a nerdy first half, and action-packed finale. The story is a bit longer and darker (you get to see an attack of flying dinos, a raptor nest, and even procompsognathids invading Costa Rica). But it is particularly interesting for its richer and incredibly well-written scientific discussions.

Here we'll focus on what the book tells us about bioengineering 30 years ago, and the future they imagined back then. Citations are in italic (I cut bits of sentences there and there for fluidity), and every non-italicized arguments and examples are from the book, unless stated otherwise.

## _“What is the biological equivalent of a Sony Walkman?”_

It is made clear from the first sentence: the book is a critic of _"the headlong and furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering, with so little outside commentary."_ TheFor the author, this started in 1976 with Genentech, the first succesfull genetic engineering company. Since then, the cash-loaded industry has outflanked academia. (_"Life is too short, and DNA too long. If you want to get something done, stay out of universities."_\* says the park's founder later in the book). As a result, _"very few molecular biologists remain without commercial affiliations"_, making it difficult to find disinterested scientists to discuss important ethical and regulatory issues.

This, the author argues, is drawing bioengineering towards _consumer biologicals_, the quest to put bio-products into everyone's hands. As a a biotech executive asks, _“what is the biological equivalent of a Sony Walkman?”_. The examples cited, which may be real or imaginary, leave no doubt on the authors view. _"A paler trout for better visibility in the stream"_ which is also tasteless, soggy and sunburned as a side effect. _"Square trees for easier lumbering"_. _"Injectable scent cells so you'll always smell of your favorite perfume"_. And an engineered mini-elephant pet.

The Jurassic Park project itself is born from a cynical approach to consumer economics: _"Fight illness and disease? Dear me, no. That’s a terrible idea. Sick people aren’t going to pay a thousand dollars a dose for needed medication, they’ll be outraged. Now if I charge $5000 a day for my park, who is going to stop me?"_. Questionable business choices were made: some genes were added to the dinos for the sole purpose of making them patentable, and others to make them grow faster (_"We didn’t want to wait. We have investors to consider."_). And it is suggested they could go further, selling pygmy dinosaur pets that can only eat food the company produces, in a typical [razor-and-blades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_and_blades_model) business model.

_"The fact that biotechnology can be applied to the industries traditionally subject to the vagaries of fashion, such as cosmetics and leisure activities, heightens concern about the whimsical use of this powerful new technology"_, the author concludes. He would probably frown at some of the projects in the portfolio of Synthetic Biology companies like Ginkgo, Zymergen, and Amyris. These include perfume from extinct flowers, (recreational) cannabinoids, [synthetic spider silk textiles shoes](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/adidas-futurecraft-biofabric-shoes) (this is of course among many other projects like drugs, biological sensors organic paint, water purification bugs, and many more). Genetically modified pets are a now a thing (from glowing fishes to hyppo-alergenic cats). And Reviving lost species is on the menu, even though there are no plans for a park just yet.

## _"Life will find a way"_.

Fence and. They made them all female to prevent reproduction (that is, until the complementary frog DNA that they added to their genome enables some dinos to spontaneously change sex). They also gave a defectuous lysine-producing enzyme to the dinos, so that they couldn't survive on their own without receiving lysine tables every 12 hours. Guess what? That doesn't work either, as dinos compensate by eating chicken, soy, agamama beans and other lysine-rich food.

As a side note, the movie repurposes the lysine strategy, making it sound like a kill-switch to be used in case of emergencies. This makes less sense, but offers more drama, with Hammond refusing to sacrifice its dinos even though his own grandchildren are in peril.

Bio-containment is a

## Bioengineering: ""

_"In making his dinosaurs, Wu had manipulated the DNA as a sculptor might clay or marble. He
had created freely"._ This probably still gives goosebumps to biodesigners today, but we are far from there. Three yet-unfulfilled premises keep dino-making from being a real job today:

First, we'd need to find near-intact genome sequences of several dinosaur species. In Jurassic Park, this DNA comes from 60-million-year-old mosquitoes trapped in amber, which is a very cool idea. In the real world, DNA traces may have been found on some bones, but [this article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/possible-dinosaur-dna-has-been-found/) says that DNA will mostly degrade in 7 million years. So mammoth and XXX are still in range, but intact dino DNA would be a huge surprise.

Second, repairing a 3-billion-basepair chromosome with possibly thousands of missing fragments is near impossible. In the book, this is done via restriction-ligation techniques, and that's a pretty generous assessment of the technique. Gene editing techniques like CRISPR are getting us there, but are not yet at that level. Another possibility would be to redesign and synthesize the genome from scratch. This could be possible in the next 10 years, after all a plan to do so with a 1-billion-basepairs human chromosome is already in the works.

Last but not least, we still don't have the biological understanding to determine what extra genes to add to a dinosaur to replace missing genes and ensure they'd survive in today's atmosphere and ecosystem.

The author goes around all of that by making Jurassic Park multi-billion dollars project with a frentic, spare-no-expense research policy. Their tools are better. They'll acquire whatever they need, even it's an amber mining company. And above all, they nailed their Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle: _Sometimes we think we have an animal correctly made-from the standpoint of the DNA, which is our basic work-and the animal grows for six months and then something untoward happens. And we realize there is some error. A releaser gene isn’t operating. A hormone not being released. Or some other problem in the developmental sequence. So we have to go back to the drawing board with that animal, so to speak.”_

A very interesting part of this approach is how they often use software metaphores to describe their projects. of the agility is that they are treating their dinosaurs like a software projects, and in particular they are versioning them: "The most recent are version 4.1 or 4.3. We’re considering going to version 4.4. Sometimes there are bugs. So, as we discover the bugs, Dr. Wu’s labs have to make a new version. And we need to keep track of what version we have out there.”\* This last sentence could be straight out of a company's firmware department!

The author doesn't want you to find this cool: _“Version numbers? You mean like software? New releases?” The idea of living creatures being numbered like software, being subject to
updates and revisions, troubled Grant._ A justification for this uneasiness is provided later in the book: versioning things gives you a false impression that you are in control, that every feature of your project is accounted for, which doesn't prepare you for the day your project does something unexpected like escaping and killing people: _"They
must have seen by now that we have everything under control. We’ve engineered
the animals and engineered the resort" (...) Whatever problems might arise in the DNA were essentially point-problems in the code, causing a speciﬁc problem in the phenotype: an enzyme that didn’t switch on, or a protein that didn’t fold. Whatever the diﬃculty, it was always solved with a relatively minor adjustment in the next version."_

> If you were going to start a bioengineering company, Henry, what would you do? Would you make products to help mankind, to fight illness and disease? Dear me, no. That’s a terrible idea. A very poor use of new technology.

> Sick people aren’t going to pay a thousand dollars a dose for needed medication-they won’t be grateful, they’ll be outraged (...) Your patent application will be denied. Your permits will be delayed. Something will force you to see reason-and to sell your drug at a lower cost.

I don't think synbio succeeded here. It will bring biology-made products in the house (food, cloth, materials) live synthetic organisms generally stay outside of your home. Hypoallergenic cat.

## Chargaff's influence

The Erwin Chargaff quote "You cannot recall a new form of life.", which opens the novel, probably inspired the famous _"Life finds a way"_. [Erwin Chargaff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Chargaff) (1905-2002), was a biochemist known for measuring the relative abundance of Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine in humans (30% A, 30% T, 20% G, 20% C) and other species. This led to the understanding that A pairs with T, and C with G, and that different species have different GC aboundance. He worked with Watson and Crick and resented not receiving the 1962 Nobel price with them. He was an opponent to genetic engineering from the 1950s to the 2000s, stating that _"the technology of genetic engineering poses a greater threat to the world than the advent of nuclear technology."_, a comparison also used in the Jurassic Park's introduction.
