If there is one thing Jurassic Park managed, it's to capture the imagination (there is a real-size Jeff Goldblum cardboard cutout by my desk, and it's wearinga Jeff Goldblum shirt)

# Biology as a business

Since the 1976 Genentech venture

# Consumer biologicals

Instead "what is the sony walkman of the ".

I don't think synbio succeeded here. It will bring biology-made products in the house (food, cloth, materials) live synthetic organisms generally stay outside of your home. Hypoallergenic cat.
